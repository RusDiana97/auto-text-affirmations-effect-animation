I created a HTML, CSS and JavaScript project for an auto affirmations effect animation. You can see some positive affirmation for more confidence.

I choosed a simple design for the project: blue background and Dancing Script font. I think that is enough for a project like this. 

For more attention from the person who reads the affirmations, with JavaScript I added an animation to these affirmations. The affirmations have a base phrase, such as "I am", than I added words like "beautiful", "proud of myself" in an array to show on the page. These words have an animation: each letter from a word appears one by one until the whole word appears.
